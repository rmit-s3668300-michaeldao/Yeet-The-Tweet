# Yeet-The-Tweet
I have many old tweets I don't want to see anymore.

A lot of online services ask for access into my twitter account, and cost money $$$$

So I used a python script.

## how to use this
Simply put, I downloaded my twitter archive straight from my twitter settings, found the consumer keys from twitter developer and combined everything together to automatically delete all my tweets from a certain date.
